2D Graphic Engine Test
2D Graphic Engine using Java Swing and AWT libraries. This project is currently under development.

Small features & Bugs to fix:

Add rotation pivot to GameObject
Bug: sprite does not get drawn in the correct position in Camera when GameObject is rotated more (or less) than 0 degrees.
Bug: in some CPUs the DeltaTime does not match the expected value.
Upcoming big features (this does not include bug fixes):

Debugging tools
Create documentation
Collision System
Animation System
Particle System
Physics System
UI System
Dynamic 2D Lighting
Post-processing effects
Shaders
